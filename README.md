## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

list of favorite ios apps
- Nike SNKRS
fave features: 
    - shows 3 items and then a view all button
    - navbar that disappears when scrolling down

- Instagram
fave features: 
    - when liking post, where you double tap, a heart appears and rises
    - long holding the share button will automatically show your friends
- Duolingo
fave features: 
    - i love the playful animations
    - pop ups display at the bottom of the page instead of the top

App brainstorm:
An app I would like to build is a sneakers app. what makes this different than current sneakers apps, like Nike SNKRS, is that the image will be interactive have a 360 display. App will allow users to get 360 view of the shoe and be able to zoom in and out. I also want a feature to design your own colorway of a sneaker by offering users with an all white silhouette. I also want to implement a feature where as you scroll down animations change. I also want to implement instagram's long hold sharing feature.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
